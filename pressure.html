<p>One day in the late 80s, I attended a day-long seminar in the Plymouth Arts Centre in which I shared the platform with the poet David Gascoygne and the psychologist R. D. Laing. I had known Gascoygne at the time of The Outsider, and been impressed by the force of his religious poetry. Laing I had never met before, although we had often come close to it on the 'New Age' lecture circuit in America. He told me he had decided to write his first book, The Divided Self, because he had read The Outsider and felt he ought to be able to write something equally successful.</p>
<p>That day, Gascoygne lectured on surrealism, and seemed to take the view that life itself is bizarre and surrealistic. Laing argued his theory that the mentally ill are not really ill, but are simply reflecting the sickness of our society. I explained why I had come to reject the pessimistic existentialism of Sartre and Camus, to create a form of existentialism whose implications are fundamentally optimistic.</p>
<p>To my surprise, Laing and Gascoyne seemed to take this personally. When the three of us finally got together on the platform for a symposium, they turned on me, taking the view that if I could be optimistic, it must be because I was shallow and superficial. They made no attempt to argue their case, but behaved like two schoolboys ganging up on a third. I suddenly realised that they were actually affronted by my optimism, not simply on a level of ideas, but on a personal level.</p>
<p>Thinking about this later, I began to understand the reason. Gascoyne had had several nervous breakdowns, and his haunted eyes showed it. Laing was an alcoholic whose drunkenness led to his deregistration as a medical practitioner - although I did not know about this until I read a biography of him written after his death in 1989.</p>
<p>'Outsiders' - and both Laing and Gascoyne were undoubtedly of the Outsider type - are abnormally sensitive to this problem of 'Everlasting Yes' versus 'Everlasting No'. A friend of mine, the poet Charles Wrey Gardiner, wrote an autobiography entitled The Answer to Life is No. Gascoyne and Laing had reached the same conclusion. That was why they saw my optimism as some kind of criticism of themselves.</p>
<p>What they were failing to grasp was that this optimism was not a matter of temperament, but of logic. My starting point in The Outsider had been those nineteenth-century Romantics who had experienced moments of overwhelming delight, of visions that filled them with optimism and affirmation - and then awakened the next morning to wonder what the hell they meant by it. So many of them had died insane or committed suicide - in effect, having decided that 'the answer to life is No'.</p>
<p>They felt that life is ultimately tragic because the 'moments of vision' seem to evaporate and leave nothing behind. Pushkin compared the poet's heart to a coal that glows red when the wind of inspiration blows on it, but turns into a black cinder when the wind dies away. Most of my 'Outsiders' seemed to feel that everyday life is a bore - what de Lisle Adam's Axel meant when he said: 'As for living, our servants can do that for us.'</p>
<p>The problem, clearly, was that there was no simple method of summoning the 'moment of vision'. What human beings seemed to need, as far as I could see, was a kind of pump on the front of their heads, like the pump of a primus stove, so they could increase the inner pressure with a few strokes. It was true that drugs or alcohol could sometimes do it, but they obviously carried heavy penalties. There had to be some other way.</p>
<p>In 1962, I made the acquaintance of the American psychologist Abraham Maslow, who had identified what he called 'peak experiences', feelings of sudden bubbling happiness. Typical was the experience of one of his students who was working his way through college as a jazz drummer. One morning, in the early hours, he suddenly had a burst of new energy, and found himself drumming perfectly, unable to do a thing wrong.</p>
<p>But Maslow believed that such experiences occurred by chance, and that there was no way of inducing them. I could not wholly accept this view for I had noticed that peak experiences often occur after a sustained effort, or with sudden release of stress, with its surge of relief.</p>
<p>One such occasion happened in the mid-60s, when I was driving back from Scotland with my family. We had set out from Biggar, in Lanarkshire, and I had assumed we had a journey of a hundred miles or so to reach the border. After driving for about an hour, I saw a signpost and realised I had greatly overestimated the distance; England was only about ten miles ahead. This meant we could easily reach Leeds, where an old friend lived, and stay the night there.</p>
<p>The realisation that I was closer than I thought brought a surge of cheerfulness, and since it was a sunny morning, I was soon in a mood of supercharged optimism. This feeling increased as the great hills of the Lake District came in sight. This had always been one of my favourite places, and I was familiar with its geography. But soon I began to experience the odd sensation that I could somehow see through the mountains, to what lay on the far side. I do not mean, of course, that the hills seemed literally transparent; but I felt as if I was a bird who could look down on them from a great height. This state of intensified awareness lasted an hour or more.</p>
<p>Maslow discovered that when his students began to discuss their peak experiences, they began having peak experiences all the time, and this makes sense. During the course of an ordinary day, we are constrained by a kind of natural caution, an anticipation of possible difficulties and problems, which tints our consciousness a shade of grey. Talking and thinking about peak experiences makes us realise how lucky we are, and that we can dispense with the caution and constraint. It is like realising that you have more money in the bank than you thought - or, in the case of the drive from Scotland, realising that the border was closer than I thought, and that I therefore had energy to spare.</p>
<p>Still, Maslow would point out that my Lake District experience was a matter of chance, and I would have to agree. But there was another occasion, in January 1979, when I achieved an intensity of experience through deliberate effort.</p>
<p>On Saturday 30 December 1978, I had to travel to a village called Sheepwash, in Devon, where I was due to lecture. It was raining when I set out, but as I drove through Launceston the rain began to turn to snow. I arrived at the farm called Totleigh Barton in the late afternoon, and gave my talk to a group of poetry students after dinner. That night, as I went to my chalet, the snow was thick on the ground and still falling. The next morning, it was obvious that I was not going to be able to drive back home. I phoned my wife and told her I might be stuck there for several days. That night - New Year's Eve - the cold froze the water supply.</p>
<p>The next day I tried to get my car up the slope and out to the main road. As the wheels began to spin, the others pushed me. Then we all took shovels and began the slow business of clearing the snow to the gate.</p>
<p>The narrow country lanes had ditches on either side. If I landed in one of those I would be stuck until the rescue services arrived. But with everything deep in snow, it was hard to see where the road ended and the ditch began. I sat forward in my seat, driving in second gear and staring through the windscreen with total concentration.</p>
<p>It took about two hours to reach the main Exeter road, where the snow had been churned to dirty mud, and there I could relax. I now discovered that the two hours of frantic concentration had induced a state of heightened consciousness. Everything I looked at seemed deeply interesting, as if twice as real as normal, and the cottages I passed seemed to be so fascinating that I almost wanted to stop and look more closely.</p>
<p>This state of intensity lasted all the way home, where I found that the electricity was off, and that my wife had delivered nine puppies in the night by the light of a torch.</p>
<p>The experience proved to me beyond all doubt that Maslow was mistaken. States of heightened awareness could be induced by sheer concentration.</p>
<p>I soon discovered the basic technique. When we are slightly bored, we allow our inner pressure to leak away. And suddenly it seems obvious that the world is a rather dreary place, for when our inner pressure is low, everything looks boring. On the other hand, when we have something to look forward to - even our favourite meal at dinnertime - there is something inside us that resists such leakage. The trick seems to be to induce this state of pleasant anticipation by the use of imagination, the exercise of inner freedom, even if you have nothing in particular to anticipate.</p>
<p>This could be compared to a concert audience awaiting the arrival of the conductor. There is a murmur of conversation; everyone's attention is focused on something different. Then the conductor comes in; the buzz dies away. Everyone's anticipation is suddenly focused in the same direction.</p>
<p>What happens in boredom is that we feel there is nothing 'out there' that is worth our full attention. But there is a fallacy involved here - a fallacy I began to grasp on that drive back from Sheepwash. Concentrating my attention because I might otherwise land in the ditch generated a certain 'energy of attention'. And when I was able to relax on the main road, all this accumulated energy made me see that everything is interesting. And this state was sustained during the rest of the drive home because I was now aware that the world around me was interesting, so that I was looking at it with an eager attention that generated yet more energy. I labelled this state 'positive feedback', as opposed to the negative feedback in which boredom generates yet more boredom.</p>
<p>It has been the aim of my life to learn to generate 'positive feedback' by an act of will.</p>

<p>This is why I read so much. I knew that, with luck, a book would draw me into it and excite a feeling of being alive. So I ploughed my way through gloomy Russians like Goncharov - I felt Oblomov was my first cousin - and Saltykov-Schedrin and Zamyatin, and read Ulysses for the fifth time. (When, years later, I met my first publisher, Victor Gollancz, he asked me: 'How on earth have you managed to read so much?' and I answered 'Boredom'.)</p>
<p>In fact, I glimpsed the solution in that preface that Constance Garnett used in all her translations of Dostoevsky: his description (in a letter to his brother Mikhail) of how he and other condemned 'revolutionaries' were taken out on to Semyonovsky Square in St Petersburg to be executed by firing squad. 'They barked orders over our heads, and made us put on the white shirts worn by persons condemned to execution. Being the third in the row, I concluded I had only a few minutes of life before me. I thought of you and your dear ones, and I contrived to kiss Plescheiv and Dourov, who were next to me, to bid them farewell. Suddenly the troops beat a tattoo, and we were unbound, brought back to the scaffold, and informed that his Majesty ... had spared our lives.' One of his fellow-prisoners went insane. It struck me that if Dostoevsky had been offered his freedom on condition that he promised never to be bored for the rest of his life, he would have accepted gladly, and been quite certain that he could carry out his promise.</p>
<p>I again saw the answer in Boswell's life of Johnson - which I bought myself for Christmas - when Johnson remarks: 'When a man knows he is to be hanged in a fortnight, it concentrates his mind wonderfully.' That was obviously what was wrong with my mind - lack of a sense of urgency. But how could you generate a feeling of urgency when your whole life lacked direction?</p>
<p>My only salvation obviously lay in becoming a writer. In the year as a lab assistant I had written a sequel to Man and Superman called Father and Son, in which Shaw's hero Tanner finds himself father of a son who shares none of his belief in socialism, and who feels that the evolutionism of Man and Superman still fails to address the question of whether life is an absurd joke.</p>
<p>It was shortly before this that I came upon a discovery that put an end to the nihilism and the suspicion that life was a malicious joke. In the Selected Essays of T. S. Eliot I had come upon a reference to the Hindu religious classic, the Bhagavad Gita. Since Eliot was my main literary guide - I read every book he mentioned - I immediately bought a copy of the book when I saw a new translation - by Isherwood and Prabhavananda - in our local bookshop.</p>
<p>It is a small extract from the vast Hindu epic The Mahabharata. Its hero, Arjuna, is told that he must fight against an army that includes kinsmen, and he is horrified at the thought that he might kill some of his own family. His teacher, Krishna, the incarnation of God, tells him that his misery is unnecessary. 'There never was a time when you did not exist, nor I, nor any of these princes, nor is there any time when we shall cease to be. Worn-out clothes are shed by the body; worn-out bodies are shed by the soul, like garments.'</p>
<p>Krishna then goes on to teach Arjuna the essence of the religious life. Although we are obliged to live in the world, it is important to refuse to become the slave of desire. We must learn to practise non-attachment. Human beings spend their lives tangled in a web of illusions, of Maya, and this is the cause of all their unhappiness. We must recognise them as illusions, and refuse to allow them to gain power over us.</p>
<p>This can be done by teaching yourself to meditate and to recognise that 'you' are not your body, or your emotions, or even your mind. The essence of your being is identical with Brahman, the power behind the universe, the reality that creates this web of unreality ...</p>
<p>I was a frustrated teenager, continually tormented by desires and emotions. The Gita taught me to grasp the knowledge that my soul, the Atman, is of the same nature as Brahman. It brought a tremendous sense of relief. When I was tormented by embarrassment - as teenagers are most of the time - or a feeling of humiliation, I simply had to create that sense of looking down on human life from above:</p>
<p>Though a man be the greatest of sinners,
This knowledge will carry him, like a raft
above his sin.</p>
<p>So I no longer needed to feel guilty about masturbation, or mortified by social blunders and errors. I was not an adolescent; my essence was immortal and timeless.</p>
<p>It was an incredible relief. And I soon discovered that 'meditation' was not the important part of the discipline. Merely sitting, cross-legged, for half an hour, and focusing my mind, brought a sudden feeling of inner control. I would still my mind, then I would concentrate hard, often screwing up my face until I must have looked like a demon. When, years later, I acquired one of those steel syphons for making soda water, it reminded me of that mental trick. Concentrating hard was just like screwing the little metal cylinder on to the hollow spike, and hearing the hiss as the carbon dioxide rushed into the water and made it effervescent. Suddenly my mind was sparkling.</p>
<p>So the kind of misery that had brought me to the verge of killing myself now seemed an absurdity. I would get up in the morning at half past five, and sit on the floor of my bedroom repeating:</p>
<p>Brahman is the ritual</br>
Brahman is the offering</br>
Brahman is he who offers</br>
To the fire that is Brahman</br>
When a man sees Brahman in every action</br>
He shall find Brahman.</p>
<p>Then I would put on running kit, and go for a jog around the park before setting off to my job as a lab assistant, walking across Spinney Hill Park and through the back streets of the slums where I had often visited members of my father's family in childhood. Sometimes I would stop, and simply stare at some cracked windowsill, aware that anything on which we focus our full attention becomes interesting. And at the laboratory I became indifferent to the petty nagging of the physics master; his stupidity and spite could no longer touch me.</p>
<p>It was during this period that I realised I had discovered one of the secrets of human existence: if I maintained a high level of inner pressure, and declined to allow my mind to collapse into tiredness or boredom, everything went well. When I didn't, they went badly. The major problem of human beings is a tendency to allow our energies to leak. And as soon as they leak, consciousness is dimmed, and we become subject to accident. I seemed to have spent years of my teens going through life with a continual sense of anxiety, as if anticipating a blow. Now I realised that I caused the blows myself by allowing my inner pressure to escape. All I had to do was to concentrate hard, to set my mouth in a firm line and clench my jaw, and perhaps stretch my muscles like an animal waking from a nap. And as soon as I had induced this feeling of control, problems evaporated.</p>
